# SIGNATE-Boxed-Lunch-Sales-Forecasting

**Overview**
---
At a certain company O in Chiyoda-ku, a number of hungry staffs are coming up to the cafeteria for a boxed lunch at lunchtime to supply energy, which is necessary to work actively from the afternoon.
"Is it cost-effective?", "I have no time going out for lunch.", "My favorites are in the box. I will take it.".
The boxes are going off one by one as staff thoughts crossing each other. Aside to that, when they remain unsold, it is not friendly to either the environment or the seller's finances. Even when they go out of stock, it might be an opportunity loss for the seller and time loss for the staff coming to the cafeteria.
In this way, setting up a production plan based on the accurate demand forecast is considered to be important for the increase in sales of boxed lunch and waste minimization.
Therefore, Opt presents you a challenge to create a model that predicts the appropriate number of boxed lunch to produce based on the various variables such as day of week and menu.
